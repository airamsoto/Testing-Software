# Software Testing - UCM

This repository is part of the **Software Testing elective course** in the **Computer Engineering degree** at the **Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)**. The repository contains practical exercises and lab assignments focused on learning techniques to ensure **software quality** through automated testing.

## Objectives of the Course

- Introduce and apply **unit testing** concepts using JUnit.  
- Learn **integration testing** practices and their importance.  
- Use **mocking and stubbing** techniques with Mockito.  
- Perform **performance and stress testing** using JMeter.  
- Gain practical experience with **test-driven development (TDD)** principles.  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lab assignments:

- **Lab 1**: Introduction to **unit testing** with JUnit.  
- **Lab 2**: **Integration tests** implementation.  
- **Lab 3**: Using **mocks and stubs** in testing.  
- **Lab 4**: **Performance and stress testing** exercises.  

### Lab Details

Each lab folder contains:

- Java source code for exercises.  
- JUnit test classes.  
- README files or instructions specific to the lab.  

## Tools and Technologies

- **Java** (version 11 or higher)
